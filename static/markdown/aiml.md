# AI/ML service
is a data management system specifically designed for AI/ML models.
It consists of three main subcomponents: an engine that
trains AI/ML models based on training datasets retrieved by the
core services, a repository for storing those trained models, and
an inference engine that delivers predictions from the stored
models.
